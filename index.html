            It gives us several early improvements to the BG that we’re glad to have in place. Early on in AV, there were too many NPCs and they were too hard to kill. By 1.12, many had been removed and NPC health was brought down to a reasonable level. Turning in armor scraps is an encouraged, supportive activity by this point. Many capture points (mostly graveyards) had been moved away from their initial placements to gain better balance across the map.

            Is that so much different than it was in the past? My alts in TBC were literally BT ready gearwise just with badge gear, only attunements kept them out. In WotLK it got even more extreme with a new currency every tier and the ability to buy raid gear with badges from 5 mans IIRC. Sure, they were always behind my main that raided all the time, but they could have still entered a raid and hold their ground. In WotLK I pug raided on something like 4 alts.

            I'm confused... You aay there is no point in playing after seeing the content while I'm pretty sure the main argument against TF/WF is that you are forced to replay content you've done.

            Also, what's the point in removing normal and hc dungeons? The purpose of them is this:

            Normal is done while leveling for quests and slight boost in gear. 
            Heroic is there to gear for mythic. 

            We could argue that hc might be redundant to have but definitely not normal.

            I personally dislike tokens... Buying gear just feels less rewarding to me even if it's essentially the same.

            Effort/Reward ratio? I Flash of Light spammed whole Vanilla as Paladin raider, that's pressing one bloody macro 90% of the time and I got loot for it. Shiet that effort worth the reward man. By today's standards I'd be bloody LFR level, the only real effort that was there is guild leadership, because gathering 40 morons that are barely capable of mashing that one or two macros without standing in a fire was a challenge.

            is also good for herbing, if you are anything leather and up

            other then that i think you have it all man.
            also anglers raft is super good for crossing long distances of water if you want, better then ground mounts of all kinds, but yeah sky golem or lumber extractor is best way to go.
